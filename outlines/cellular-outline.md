## How do neurons work?

- Resting potential
    - What is it?
        - Inside ≠ outside
        - Electrical potential = voltage
    - How does it work?
        - Ions
            - Na++, sodium
            - K+, postassium
            - Cl-, chloride
            - A-, organic anions
            - Ca++, calcium
        - Ion channels
            - Selectively permeable
                - K+ flow greater (>>) than Na+
            - Na+/K++ pump/ATPase
        - A balance of forces
            - Diffusion
                - Outside
                    - Na+ high
                    - K+ low
                    - Cl- high
                    - Ca++ high
                - Vs. Inside
                    * Na+ low
                    * K+ high
                    * Cl- low
                    * Ca++ low
            - Electrostatic attraction/repulsion
                + Opposites attract; likes repel
                + Current = ion flow
                + Nernst Equation
- Postsynaptic potentials (PSPs)
    + Smaller than action potentials
    + Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs)
        + Move cell toward threshold (more +/less -)
    + Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs)
        + Move cell away from threshold (more -)
- Action potentials
    - Phases of the action potential
        - Rise
        - Peak
        - Fall
        - Undershoot
        - Refractory period
            - Absolute
                - Can’t fire no matter input amplitude
            - Relative
                - Can fire if input sufficiently large
    - Causes
        - Rise
            - Voltage-gated Na+ channels open
            - Voltage-gated K+ channels begin to open
        - Peak
            - Na+ channels close
        - Fall
            - Voltage-gated K+ remain open
        - Undershoot
            - Equilibrium potential of K+
            - K+ channels close
        - Refractory period
            + Absolute: Na+ channels inactivated
            + Relative: Some K+ channels still open
    - Aspects of the action potential
        - Threshold
        - All or none law
            - Once started, always completed
            - Stereotypical size, shape
