## Spatial

- Within an individual
    + molecular
        * genetic
        * receptor
    + chemical
        * neurotransmitter
    + cellular
        * neuronal firing
    + network
        * lateral inhibition
    + area
    + region
    + system

---

- External to individuals
    + Social
        * Friends, family, teachers, others
    + Non-social
        * neighborhood, school, state/region, country
        * Physical environment

---

## Temporal

- Within one lifetime
    + Microseconds
        * detection position from acoustic stimulation
    + Milliseconds
        * action potential
    + Seconds
        * changes in EEG power
        * short-term memory
    + Minutes
        * synaptic plasticity
    + Hours
        * memory consolidation
    + Days
    + Weeks
    + Months
    + Years
        * education & training
        * disease processes
        * cultural change
    + Centuries
        * cultural changes
    + Millenia

## Let's find some examples...

---

## Why does this matter?

- Challenge of interpretation
- Challenge of linking phenomena across levels

---

## Case study 1: Poverty and the Brain

- Hanson et al. (2013). Family Poverty Affects the Rate of Human Infant Brain Growth. PLOS One. <http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0080954>

## Case study 2: Pesticides and the Brain

- Rauh et al. (2012). PNAS. Brain anomalies in children exposed prenatally to a common organophosphate pesticide. <http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1203396109>
