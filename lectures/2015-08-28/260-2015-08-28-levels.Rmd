## Spatial Resolution in Detail

- Within an individual
    + molecular
        * genetic
        * receptor
    + chemical
        * neurotransmitter
    + cellular
        * neuronal firing

## Spatial Resolution in Detail

- Internal to individuals
    + network
        * lateral inhibition
    + area
    + region
    + system

## Spatial Resolution in Detail

- External to individuals
    + Social
        * Friends, family, teachers, others
    + Non-social
        * neighborhood, school, state/region, country
        * Physical environment

## Temporal Resolution in Detail

- Within one lifetime
    + Microseconds
        * detection position from acoustic stimulation
    + Milliseconds
        * action potential
    + Seconds
        * changes in EEG power
        * short-term memory
    + Minutes
        * synaptic plasticity
    + Hours
        * memory consolidation

## Temporal Resolution in Detail

- Within one lifetime
    + Days
    + Weeks
    + Months
    + Years
        * education & training
        * disease processes
        * cultural change
- Across lifetimes
    + Centuries
        * cultural changes
    + Millenia

## Why does this matter?

- Different methods, different levels of analysis.
- Challenge of interpretation.
- Challenge of linking phenomena across levels.

## Case study 1: Poverty and the Brain

- Hanson et al. (2013). Family Poverty Affects the Rate of Human Infant Brain Growth. PLOS One. 

<http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0080954>

## Case study 2: Pesticides and the Brain

- Rauh et al. (2012). PNAS. Brain anomalies in children exposed prenatally to a common organophosphate pesticide. 

<http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1203396109>

## [Systems Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking)

- Systems are
    + Bounded in space
    + Bounded in time
  
## Systems Thinking

- Systems have
    + Inputs
    + Outputs
- Systems
    + Have purposes/functions
    + Transform inputs to outputs
    + Operate autonomously
  
## Your turn

- Pick a system you know something about
- Identify boundaries, inputs/outputs, functions
- Evaluate the levels of analysis important to understanding its function

## Next Time

- Methods in neuroscience research
